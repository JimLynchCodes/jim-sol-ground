# jim-sol-ground

Some Solana programs and front-end clients made by Jim.

<br/>

## Playground Code

There is no "Cargo.toml" in anywhere in this repo because these files are meant to be used on the [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io).

<br/>

Each folder represents a separate, standalone dapp project.

<br/>

## Deploying Program

Paste the from `program.rs` into the playground. 

Click the **Build** button.

Then click the **Deploy** button.

Notice how the playground fills in the `declare_id!` empty string with the id of the program that it just deployed.
